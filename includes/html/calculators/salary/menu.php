                A salary calculator is a tool that helps estimate the net income of an individual after deducting taxes and other contributions. It requires input of details such as gross income, tax code, pension contributions, and other deductions. Based on this information, the calculator provides an estimate of the take-home pay for a given period. A salary calculator can help individuals understand their net income and plan their budget accordingly.
