        <h2>Basic Salary Information</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here are some key points about salaries in the UK
    </p>
    <ul class="info--lists">
        <li>
            Salaries in the UK are typically expressed as an annual figure, before tax deductions. For example, if your salary is £30,000 per year, this means you would receive £2,500 per month before tax.
        </li>
        <li>
            The amount of salary you can expect to earn in the UK depends on a variety of factors, including your industry, level of experience, and location. Generally, salaries are higher in London and other major cities than in more rural areas.
        </li>
        <li>
            UK workers are entitled to a certain amount of paid holiday each year, which varies depending on their job and length of service. Full-time workers are entitled to a minimum of 28 days' paid holiday per year, including public holidays.
        </li>
        <li>
            When negotiating your salary with an employer, it's important to research the average salary for your industry and level of experience to ensure you're being offered a fair wage. You may also want to consider other factors such as benefits, work-life balance, and opportunities for career advancement.

        <h2>National Living & Minimum Wages</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        The UK has a national minimum wage, which is the lowest hourly rate that employers are legally required to pay most workers. The minimum wage varies depending on the age of the worker and whether they are an apprentice. As of April 2023, the minimum wage rates will be as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="info--lists">
        <li>
            £10.42 per hour for workers aged 23 and over
        </li>
        <li>
            £10.18 per hour for workers aged 21 to 22
        </li>
        <li>
            £7.49 per hour for workers aged 18 to 20
        </li>
        <li>
            £5.28 per hour for workers under 18
        </li>
        <li>
            £5.28 per hour for apprentices (or the apprentice rate if they are aged 19 or over and in the first year of their apprenticeship)
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        It is illegal for your employer to pay you less than the National Minimum/Living Wage, so check your pay and talk to your manager to make sure you’re getting the pay rate increase you are entitled to.

        <h2>Income Tax Information</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        In the UK, the tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year.
    </p>
    <p>
        The amount of income tax you pay can be reduced by certain tax reliefs and allowances, such as the Personal Savings Allowance and the Marriage Allowance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Self-employed workers in the UK have to pay income tax on their profits, which is the income they earn after deducting their business expenses. The tax rates and bands for self-employed workers are the same as for employees.
    </p>
    <p>
        Income tax rates in the UK are divided into bands. Each band has a different tax rate, so you pay a higher percentage of tax on your income as your earnings increase. For the tax year 2022/23, the tax rates and bands are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul class="info--lists">
        <li>
            0% on income up to £12,570 (personal allowance)
        </li>
        <li>
            20% on income between £12,571 and £50,270
        </li>
        <li>
            40% on income between £50,271 and £125,140
        </li>
        <li>
            45% on income over £125,140
        </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        It is illegal for your employer to pay you less than the National Minimum/Living Wage, so check your pay and talk to your manager to make sure you’re getting the pay rate increase you are entitled to.

        <h2>National Insurance Information</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here are some key points about National Insurance in the UK:
    </p>
    <ul class="info--lists">
        <li>
            National Insurance (NI) is a tax that is used to fund state benefits such as the National Health Service (NHS), the State Pension, and other social security benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Most workers in the UK have to pay National Insurance contributions if they are aged 16 or over and earn more than a certain amount.
        </li>
        <li>
            Employees pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions, which are deducted from their pay by their employer. For the tax year 2022/23, the Class 1 National Insurance rates are as follows:
            <ul class="uk-margin-small-top">
                <li>
                    12% on earnings between £9,568 and £50,270
                </li>
                <li>
                    2% on earnings above £50,270
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Self-employed workers pay Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance contributions. Class 2 contributions are a flat rate of £3.05 per week, and are payable if your profits are above a certain threshold. Class 4 contributions are a percentage of your profits, and are payable if your profits are above a different threshold. For the tax year 2022/23, the Class 4 National Insurance rates are as follows:
            <ul class="uk-margin-small-top">
                <li>
                    9% on profits between £9,568 and £50,270
                </li>
                <li>
                    2% on profits above £50,270
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Some workers, such as those who earn less than the National Insurance threshold, may be able to pay voluntary National Insurance contributions to protect their entitlement to certain state benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can check your National Insurance record and make sure you are paying the right amount of National Insurance contributions by setting up a Personal Tax Account on the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) website.
